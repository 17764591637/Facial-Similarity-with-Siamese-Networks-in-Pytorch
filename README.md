The goal is to teach a siamese network to be able to distinguish pairs of images. 
This project uses pytorch. 

Any dataset can be used. Each class must be in its own folder. This is the same structure that PyTorch's own image folder dataset uses.

You can find the project requirements in requirements.txt
